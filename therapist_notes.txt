That's impressive. That's awesome.

The biggest thing would be more sounds. Joking about all 46 but R and S and L are the big ones. CH and K and G for younger kids. That is one thing I would change.

The general concept is great. I think kids would actually enjoy playing this game and would use it often.

Right off the top, I can't think of anything critical at all... in terms of improvement, I'm hoping you will continue to work on this after the quarter ends.

Adding more words and consulting with me in the future to see what would be appropriate in the future. The other thing is the kids who would use this are definitely towards the younger side. Taking it a step further, and making multiple levels (more syllable words). Older kids tend to have more of a vocabulary, so maybe something for them would be useful. There is probably a huge market to be explored there.

The other thing is, you are currently working at the word level. The next level would be phrases and then sentences. You could expand this to a lot of areas.

What you've done in this short period of time, is awesome. It's a really cool idea.
